## Default variables for the Ansible tmpdir role.
##
## These variables have the lowest priority and can be overriden at runtime.
## The temporary directory is only created once per playbook, so modifying
## these variables after that will have no effect. Other roles that use this
## role cannot depend on being able to change these values.
##
tmpdir_root: "{{ ansible_env.TMPDIR|default('/tmp') }}"
tmpdir_template: tmp.XXXXXXXX
tmpdir_path: ""  # set at runtime
tmpdir_force: false  # force removal as root
